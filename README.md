## 🔍 Project Overviews

### 🔹 1. **SVM on FIFA Multi-Year Dataset**

📁 `SVM on Multiple CSVs.ipynb`

* Loads and merges multiple CSVs: `players_15.csv` to `players_20.csv`, and `teams_and_leagues.csv`
* Cleans the data using pandas, handles missing values, and encodes categorical features
* Trains an **SVR (Support Vector Regression)** model to predict the `overall` player rating
* Highlights preprocessing and merging of multi-source datasets

---

### 🔥 2. **Churn Prediction with Telco Dataset**

📁 `Churn_prediction ML project.ipynb`

* Classification task based on a Telco customer dataset loaded from **Google Drive**
* Converts categorical variables via one-hot encoding and binary mapping
* Trains and evaluates multiple regression models: `LinearRegression`, `Ridge`, `Lasso`, `RandomForestRegressor`
* Uses **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)** to select the best model
* Demonstrates practical business problem solving with ML

---

### 📈 3. **Stock Exchange Dataset – Model Comparison**

📁 `Different Models of ML.ipynb`

* Loads and combines `securities.csv`, `fundamentals.csv`, `prices.csv`, and `prices-split-adjusted.csv`
* Cleans data, drops unnecessary features, and prepares it for regression modeling
* Applies models including:

  * `LinearRegression`, `Lasso`, `Ridge`
  * `RandomForestRegressor`, `GradientBoostingRegressor`
* Evaluates models using **MSE (Mean Squared Error)** to identify the best performer
* Teaches robust data merging and multi-model experimentation

---

### ✍️ 4. **Handwritten Digit Recognition**

📁 `Hand_Written_Dataset Recognition.ipynb`

* A classification task focused on recognizing digits using images
* Likely based on **MNIST dataset** or similar
* Demonstrates:

  * Image loading and flattening
  * Training classifiers using scikit-learn or TensorFlow
  * Accuracy evaluation and visual results
* Excellent for understanding image preprocessing and basic CNN/MLP models

---

### 📐 5. **2D Point Dataset Classification**

📁 `2D point dataset.ipynb`

* Simple classifier trained on 2D synthetic dataset
* Perfect for beginners to:

  * Visualize decision boundaries
  * Understand model behavior in low dimensions
* Uses visual plots to explain predictions
